  <h3>Simple <em>XML</em> parser implementation.</h3>
  <p>This package contains simple <em>XML</em> parser implementation. The main
   idea was to create lightweight parser supporting multithreaded processing with
   special focus on efficiency. So it supports only basic <em>XML</em>
   structures but enough for many simple cases like parsing <em>XML</em> streams
   from network connections, processing <em>XML</em> files containing
   configuration or for simple <em>XML</em> data base implementation.</p>
  <p>Base classes define and implement <em>SAX</em> style parser:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><code>SimpleParser</code> - implementation of <em>SAX</em> parser. This
    is very basic implementation of <em>XML</em> parser designed especially to
    be light and parse <em>XML</em> streams like jabber <em>XML</em> stream. It
    is very efficient, capable of parsing parts of <em>XML</em> document
    received from the network connection as well as handling a few <em>XML</em>
    documents in one buffer. This is especially useful when parsing data
    received from the network. Packets received from the network can contain non-complete
    <em>XML</em> document as well as a few complete <em>XML</em> documents. It
    doesn't support <em>XML</em> comments, processing instructions, document
    inclusions. Actually it supports only:
    <ul>
     <li>Start element event (with all attributes found).</li>
     <li>End element even.</li>
     <li>Character data event.</li>
     <li>'Other-XML' data event - everything between '&#60;' and '&#62;' if after
      &#60; is '?' or '!'. So it can 'catch' doc-type declaration, processing
      instructions but it can't process correctly commented blocks.</li>
    </ul> Although very simple this implementation is sufficient for Jabber
    protocol needs and is even used by some other packages of this server like
    implementation of <code>UserRepository</code> based on <em>XML</em> file or
    server configuration.
    <p>It is worth to note also that this class is fully thread safe. It means that
     one instance of this class can be simultaneously used by many threads. This
     is to improve resources usage when processing many client connections at
     the same time.</p>
   </li>
   <li><code>SimpleHandler</code> - parser handler interface for event driven
    parser. It is very simplified version of
    <code>org.xml.sax.ContentHandler</code> interface created for
    <code>SimpleParser</code> needs. It allows to receive events like start
    element (with element attributes), end element, element c-data, other <em>XML</em>
    content and error event if <em>XML</em> error found.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Based on above <em>SAX</em> parser there is also <em>DOM</em>
   implementation. Classes used to build <em>DOM</em> for <em>XML</em> content
   are:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><code>DomBuilderHandler</code> - implementation of
    <code>SimpleHandler</code> building <em>DOM</em> structures during parsing
    time. It also supports creation of multiple, sperate document trees if parsed
    buffer contains a few <em>XML</em> documents. As a result of work it returns
    always <code>Queue</code> containing all found <em>XML</em> trees in the
    same order as they were found in network data.<br/>
    Document trees created by this <em>DOM</em> builder consist of instances of
    <code>Element</code> class or instances of class extending
    <code>Element</code> class. To receive trees built with instances of proper
    class user must provide <code>ElementFactory</code> implementation creating
    instances of required <code>ELement</code> extension.</li>
   <li><code>Element</code> - basic document tree node implementation.
    Supports Java 5.0 generic types to make it easier to extend and
    still preserve some useful functionality. Sufficient for simple cases but
    probably in the most more advanced cases should be extended with additional
    features. Look in API documentation for more details and information about
    existing extensions. The most important features apart from obvious tree
    implementation are:
    <ul>
     <li><code>toString()</code> implementation so it can generate valid
      <em>XML</em> content from this element and all children.</li>
     <li><code>addChild(...)</code>, <code>getChild(childName)</code> supporting
      generic types.</li>
     <li><code>findChild(childPath)</code> finding child in subtree by given
      path to element.</li>
     <li><code>getChildCData(childPath)</code>, <code>getAttribute(childPath,
       attName)</code> returning element c-data or attribute from child in
      subtree by given path to element.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li><code>ElementFactory</code> is interface definition for factories
    creating proper instances of <code>Element</code> class or its extension.</li>
   <li><code>DefaultElementFactory</code> is an <code>ElementFactory</code>
    implementation creating instances of basic <code>Element</code> class. This
    implementation exists to offer complementary implementation of
    <em>DOM</em>. It can be used when basic <code>Element</code> class is
    sufficient for particular needs.</li>
   <li><code>SingletonFactory</code> provides a way to use only one instance of
    <code>SimpleParser</code> in all your code.
    Since <code>SimpleParser</code> if fully thread safe implementation there is
    no sense to use multiple instances of this class. This in particular useful
    when processing a lot of network connections sending <em>XML</em> streams
    and using one instance for all connections can save some resources.<br/>
    Of course it is still possible to create as many instances of
    <code>SimpleParser</code> you like in normal way using public constructor.</li>
  </ul>
